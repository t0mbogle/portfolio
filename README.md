# Personal portfolio
This is a repo for my personal portfolio, which showcases some of the skills I have learnt over the past months,
utilising HTML and CSS.

## Access
This application is yet to be deployed, so if you would like to view it, please fork and clone this repo.

## Roadmap
Currently not recieving updates, however, in the near future JavaScript features will be added. Also, front and back-end projects will be added and viewable in the projects section to showcase other software engineering skills within the full-stack.
