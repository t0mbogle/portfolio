<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I am a creative individual looking forward to jumping into the tech world and seeing what is has to offer!</p>
<p>I first got into code via my sister who thought it was something that would interest me. 
    I enjoy problem solving and like the challenge which is keeping me motivated to continue with it and up-skill :)</p>
